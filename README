NAME

    Acme::JavaTrace - Module for using Java-like stack traces


DESCRIPTION

    <buzzword> This module tries to improves the Perl programmer 
    experience by porting the Java paradigm to print stack traces, 
    which is more professional than Perl's way. </buzzword>

    This is achieved by modifying the functions warn() and die() 
    in order to replace the standard messages by complete stack traces 
    that precisely indicates how and where the error or warning occurred. 
    Other than this, their use should stay unchanged, even when using 
    die() inside eval(). 

    For a explanation of why I wrote this module, you can read the sildes 
    of my lightning talk "Entreprise Perl", available here: 
      http://maddingue.org/conferences/yapc-eu-2004/entreprise-perl/
